/**************USER CREATION************************************/
We have 2 realm pam & proxmox user, both can access GUI
If we create pam user password will not be there and it will not listed in /etc/passwd
If we create proxmox user, we can create password but can't able to access linux
To resolve this : create pam user in GUI 
login to CLI with root access give below commands
adduser admin
add user and set password and other details
now user can able to access both cli and gui, but still access to all options won't be available
To get full access: add 'new group' with admin name, click on create
Now click on "permissions"; add "group permissions"
give path /, select group, give 'role' click add
Final step: Go back to user, 'edit' assign group to that user.
Check access with new user login, you can now able to access all VM's and options
